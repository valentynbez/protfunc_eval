# Function prediction methods

## Instalation

Please, install `conda` on your computer to navigate different environments. It is necessary. 

## 1. Clone repository with submodules
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/valentynbez/protfunc_eval
```

## 2. Install all environments from `envs` directory
Tools are built in a very messy way, it is what it is. **Please, do not rename environments**
